Susucoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Susucoin Core is the original Susucoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Susucoin transactions (which is currently more than 100 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Susucoin Core, visit [susucoincore.org](https://susucoincore.org/en/releases/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Susucoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/susucoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/susucoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run susucoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Susucoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Susucoin-Core.
